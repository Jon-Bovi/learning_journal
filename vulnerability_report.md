# Housecall - Learning_journal

I initially tried to access other routes within the site by trying different views but was unable to find anything other than the log in page and the 404 not found page.

After that my only option was to attempt to inject some scripts into the log in form and I attempted to do so in both the username and password fields.  This did not work.

At this point, i don't have any idea where else I could go to try and break into the site. At this point it seems pretty secure to me.
